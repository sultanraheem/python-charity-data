# deep-learning-challenge

This repository contains the code and resources for a deep learning project focused on building and training a neural network model to classify charity funding success based on organizational and application features.

Key components of the project include:

Data Preprocessing:
Cleaning and transforming raw data into a suitable format for modeling, including handling categorical variables and scaling features.

Model Architecture:
Designing and implementing a multi-layer deep neural network using TensorFlow/Keras to predict whether a charity application will be successful.

Model Training and Evaluation:
Training the model on training data, validating on a test set, and evaluating performance metrics such as accuracy and loss.

Results and Insights:
Providing insights on feature importance, model effectiveness, and potential business implications for charity funding prediction.
